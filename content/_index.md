Hello there, dear traveller of the depths of the web, welcome to ETH-Ankidoc.

This is the place where I continually put up all the anki flashcards I make
during my studies at the ETH. I'm not very sure that it will be of use to
anyone but me, but I'll be glad if it is. :)

Please note that while I have indeed written these cards, the actual _content_
is intellectual property of the lecturers at ETH. Links and references to all
courses are provided on the deck pages. Also note that, while the original
content _was_ produced by the lecturers at ETH, these cards are a reformulation
of mine, and are therefore prone to contain errors and inaccuracies. If you
find any of those, you're very welcome to send me an email or open an issue or
a merge request on the (ETH-internal) GitLab repositories on which the cards
are hosted. You'll find the links to those on the deck pages as well.
